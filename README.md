# World Clocks

Web app to create custom board of world clocks using dmfilipenko/timezones.json API.

Created with React, Sass. Uses LocalStorage.

It allows to search through a list of 400 cities all over the world and add their times to the Clock Board. 
Seasonal changes of time are not taken into accound so sometimes the clock can be off by +- 1 hour.
